        <h1>Beta-007</h1>
        <p>This project is a work in progress and was created using Quarkus by two web developer students, Vinicius
            and Rodrigo. Our goal is to provide a free, open-source and online-based meteorological service for
            everyone, that contains all you need without being complicated and messy to use.</p>

        <p>This website utilizes <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api">OpenWeatherMapAPI</a>, a global weather
            data system.</p>
